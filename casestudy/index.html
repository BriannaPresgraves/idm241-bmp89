    <h1> IDM 241 Case Study </h1>

    <div class="content">

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project, I took an existing set of microinteractions and improved them through the use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I was able to learn more about and dive deeper into properties in CSS and Javascript that I hadn't used before to finish this project.</p>

    <h2>Context & Challenge</h2>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>At the beginning of this 11 weel course, we were assigned to each develop predictive and enjoyable interactive designs based on a holistic consideration of users experience. It was broken up into three assignments that would build off of each other: the Alpha, the Beta, and the Final. We had to create a description for each that would include the microinteraction source that we wished to improve upon as well as list the triggers, rules, feedback, loops and modes that correlated with the microinteraction. Then we had to actually build and develope the microinteraction as well as list the triggers, rules, feedback, loops and modes again. </p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>For this project, we had to take an existing microinteraction and improve on it. We also had to describe in full detail, its triggers, rules, feedback, loops, and modes in full detail. We had to create all this on a site layout that would be clear, readable, and responsive.</p>

    <h3>Goals & Objectives</h3>
    <p>My main goal for this project was to create and code clear feedback for users when they hovered or clicked on parts of the microinteraction. I wanted to build meaningful microinteractions that were functional, user-friendly, and gave users clear feedback. I also wanted to use this project to further develop my skills and knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

    <h2>Process & Insight</h2>
    <h3>Alpha</h3>
    <p>For the first assignment, I had to focus on a singular, simple microinteraction that I wanted to rebuild and only had one or two triggers. I chose to rebuild the Design Season scrolling microinteraction. On their site, they have a microinteraction for whne you're scrolling up or down the page. There's a graphic at each section and as you scroll down the page, after arriving at a new section, they will follow you as you continue scrolling down the page. I chose to focus on that microinteraction for this assignment. While rebuilding it, I did run into a few issues like getting the grphics the stay on teh screen as the user scrolled and making sure the graphics didn't overlap. By looking at different examples of code similar to this microinteraction, I was able to build and manipulate the code to help recreate the microinteraction I wanted. </p>

    <h3>Beta</h3>
    <p>I switched to another microcinteraction for this project because I wasn't sure how to incoorperate more triggers into the scrolling microinteraction. For this assignment, our microinteraction had to have at least 3 triggers. I chose to recreate and improve upon Scully and Scullys product information tile microinteraction and the quick shop modal but for this assignment I only focused on the product information tile. I implemented a image carousel so users could click through the different images of the product with out going onto the product information page. I also included the quickshop button which would appear when users hover over the tile and the tile would gain a drop a drop shadow when hovered on as well. When user hovered over the button the text changes to white. </p>

    <h3>Final</h3>
    <p>After improving my previous iteration based on the in-class feedback I recieved, the next assignment was the final. For the final, our microinteration had to have at least 5 triggers. This is when I decided to incorporate the quick shop modal that woulld fade in when users clicked on the quick shop button. I added fading effects to my previous iteratio so nothing just instantly appeared which can be jarring for users. In the quick shop modal, I added a quantity button so users could chose to buy more then one of the item. I also included an add to cart button and a heart so users could favorite the item. When hovering over the add to cart button, the button its self would quickly fade to a darker blue. Then when users hovered over the heart icon, it would quickly fade to pink.</p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p><a href="https://bmp89.net/idm241/final/build/" target="_blank" class="hover-link"> Live Final Microinteraction </a></p>
    <p>After a couple interactions and some debugging with the quick shop modal, I ended up with a set of microinteractions that met most of my initial goals. I was able to provide as much clear feedback to the user as possible when interaction with the product information tile and quick shop modal. I did struggle with implementing the quick shop modal but was able to find some sample code online that I could use and modify to fix the issues that I was having. </p>

    <h2>The Results</h2>
    <p>Overall, I would say the project was a success. Throughout the process of coding these microinteractions, I was able to dive deeper into CSS and Javascript properties that I hadn't used before. I learned a lot about finding sample code adn then manipulating it to integrate into my own code. I learned about how many small components actually make up a simple microinteraction and th eimpact they can have on a users experience. </p>
